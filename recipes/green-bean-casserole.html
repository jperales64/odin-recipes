    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Created by Campbell Test Kitchen Manager Dorcas Reilly in 1955, its creamy, smooth sauce and 
        unmatchable flavor combined with its simplicity makes Green Bean Casserole so appealing. 
        Just five ingredients and 10 minutes to put together, this family pleasing side has been a 
        favorite for over 60 years.
